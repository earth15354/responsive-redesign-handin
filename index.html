            This project for my User Interface and User Experience involes picking and redesigning an existing website to be more 
            user friendly. The website I picked was one designed for the Thong Lor branch of Audrey Cafe: a cafe chain located in Thailand.
            An image of the original website can be seen above. This portfolio will go through the processes I took
            as I undertook this project and my observations at each step.

    <h2>Part 1: Picking a Webpage and Brainstorming</h2>
    <div class="paragraphs">
        <p>
            I chose this site because: 
            <br>
            1. I wanted to do something related to my home country, Thailand, so I started my search 
            by looking through multiple websites of local businesses. 
            <br>
            2. I was able to see some very clear interfacing issues with this site as I tried to use it, so I already had initial ideas
            of what I would want to redesign
            <br>
            3. Lastly, I needed to determine if the website was possible to redesign within the time scale of the project
            and it looked like it had a pretty simple design with clear sections and content to include, so I felt like
            it was a realistic site to pick.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraphs">
        <p>
            When I first visited the site, I saw some clear interfacing issues such as missing images, incosistent fonts, and very small or low contrast text that was hard
            to read. Furthermore, a lot of important elements, like the links to the cafe's socials and a "reserve" button to reserve places at the cafe, were very small and not 
            made prominent. As I dug deeper, I tried running the site through "Wave", an online tool to roughly test the usability of websites and found that the site
            had many bugs related to contrast and images lacking alternate text. Finally, I tried running the site through a screen reader and realized that
            many components of the site weren't being recognized as text, since they used images to import fancy fonts. This made the fonts look very
            scattered and made it hard to read some important contents in the site, such as the tabs in the navbar.

    </div>

    <div class="paragraphs">
        <p>
            After I had an idea of what things to fix in the site, I started planning by drawing 9 sketches, shown above,
            followed by a final sketch which combined some ideas from the 9 sketches. I liked having a somewhat consistent navbar
            near the top of the page and a large image centered on the page when you newly click on the page. Lastly, I liked
            when the information blocks were divided into clear sections, because that made content on the page much easier to find.

    <h2>Part 2: Low Fidelity Wireframes and High Fidelity Mockups</h2>
    <div class="imgs">
        <img id="up-img" alt="Lowfi iphone image" src="./assets/lowfi_small.png"/>
        <img id="up-img" alt="Lowfi ipad and computer image" src="./assets/lowfi_big.png"/>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraphs">
        <p>
            Above are my low-fidelity wireframes for the project. I annotated some of the elements I was paying attention to as I was designing.
            In general, I really wanted the wireframe to have clear and consistent sections and buttons, so a user would not be confused looking at the 
            site as I was when I first took a look at the orignal.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="imgs">
        <img id="up-img-small" alt="Page elements sheet" src="./assets/elements.png"/>
        <img id="up-img-small" alt="Site colors" src="./assets/colors.png"/>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraphs">
        <p>
            After the low fidelity wireframe, I made a sheet to store repeating elements I would use,
            such as what buttons would look like before and after being pressed, and the fonts of different sections
            in my final site. Additionally, I made a list of colors I would use, using coolers.co to generate a set of colors
            that looked nice (in my opinion) and were somewhat consistent with the original site's color scheme.
        </p>   
    </div>
    <div class="imgs">
        <img id="up-img" alt="Highfi iphone image" src="./assets/highfi_small.png"/>
        <img id="up-img" alt="Highfi ipad and computer image" src="./assets/highfi_big.png"/>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraphs">
        <p>
            Finally, I designed high fidelity models of the site. As I made these, I tried to make the buttons stand out 
            as much as possible (so the user would know they are clickable) and I tried to keep the format consistent with the 
            low-fi wireframe, albeit with more flashy elements and colors. Something I didn't anticipate in my low-fi was having to 
            create an open menu for the navbar in phone-interfaces, so I had to create a second phone high-fi mockup for when
            the navbar was open.

    <h2>Part 3: Final Redesign and Conclusions</h2>

        Final redesign on computer (above) and phone (below)

    </div>
    <div class="paragraphs">
        <p>
            After redesigning the site and running the new site through "Wave", the number of errors reduced format
            32 to 1. Additionally, after playing around with the browser width and height, as well as the zoom values of the browser,
            I found the website is responsive to such changes and is able to switch to a "mobile view" with a hidden navbar
            when the screen width becomes smaller. Finally, I tried running the website through google translate in Thai,
            Japanese, and Spanish, and for all these languages, the site looked fine.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraphs">
        <p>
            In terms of things I would like to improve if I had more time, I would have liked to implement the features described in my high-fi model
            for clicking the hidden navbar to keep it open, and dimming the other elements in the page in response to opening the navbar.
            I wasn't able to find a way to do so using just HTML and CSS because the elements in my HTML page can't be altered relative to screen size.
            I tried using "navbar:active" when it's clicked to make it stay open when clicking, but I was never able to get it to work consistently.
